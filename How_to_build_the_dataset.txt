Goto the page:
http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators
This pre-selects in item "Database" the base ": "World Development Indicators"
(stay on the english version of the site, to avoid some possible problems in french due to accent in the column names)

Then choose the countries, the variables (called series or also indicators) and the year (time) as described below.

Click on section "Country" to unfold the selection details in this section. Then click on button "Countries" and click icon "select all" (it is the icon looking like a check box, not the button "All")
(Caution if you use button "All" or "Aggregates", you will not get data per country.)

Below on the page, in the section "Time", select one year (not too recent, not too far in the past)
ex : 2016

In the section Series: click the funnel icon to choose some filters to display a subset of the available series. Then click in the list on the left to select the series.

To select the data format:
Click on tab "LAYOUT" (upper-left part)
In the section "Orientation" choose:
Time: Page
Series: Column
Country: Row
Click on "APPLY CHANGES".

To download the data:
Click on "Download Options" (upper-right)
Choose in the list "Advanced Options"
In tab "DOWNLOAD FORMAT" choose format: "Tabbed TXT"
Then select:
Export range: Entire dataset
Data format: Table
Variable format: both codes and names (to get codes AND long names for countries and indicators)
NA preferences: Blank
Text field delimiter: " (but this option seems to have no effect)
Metadata: No

Then click on the button "Download" (bottom-right)

Two files are obtained:
- one file containing the data, using one "TAB" (character tabulation) as field separator.
- another file containing the definitions, codes and long names of the indicators.

=============================================================================
To read the data file:

- suppress with a text editor the last lines of the data file that may contain information not related the the variable values (empty lines, date of last updated of the data, ...)

- if needed, edit the names of the variables in the data file (on the first line) to use more compact names (keep the tabs as separator).

- read the file (using tab as separator), check that the types of the variables have been recognized correctly (string and float).

- suppress the variables having many missing values, and after this step suppress the objects still having at least one missing value.
